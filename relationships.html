The confusion, whether to get into relationship or not is now getting deeper and deeper.<br>
The reason being, people are now much more concerned about their careers than ever
before and hence promise themselves to establish their career first and then only focus on
relationship business.<br>
<i>However</i>, there are very less people who are able to keep up with their promise and end up
being in a relationship. Eventually somehow they find themselves in a situation where they
regret and enjoy at the same time.<br>
<h3>Well that’s the problem we all know and one might ponder over various questions that
could range from-</h3><br><b>
Should I get into relationship?<br>
Should I keep it casual?<br>
How would it impact my future?<br>
How do I stop myself from getting into one?<br></b>
And can be many more.<br>
<h3>For the solution, let’s understand the relationship business.</h3>
To understand it, you have to first contemplate the two basic aspects of your body which
means your body understands only two things which are <i>SURVIVAL</i> and <i>REPRODUCTION</i>.<br>
Hence, as u manage your survival by providing it with food, the next thing that your body
demands is the physical need.<br>
Now you know why u feel the urge to get into relationship and despite your resistant
efforts, you get into one.<br>
<h3>The Doorway</h3>
Although there are other factors that your mind plays that let you choose your partner, are also involved such as feelings,
emotions, infatuations, attachments, cognitive understanding and these all make when
combined is the doorway to the physical aspect.<br>
Does it mean we are bound to get physical irrelevant of our being resistant?<br>
No, <i>only animals feel bound to get physical because of the absence of consciousness in
them but we humans have the consciousness to control and decide everything about us.</i><br>
So, the next question that arises is,
<h3>How do I control myself?</h3>
There’s nothing to control about.<br>
The confusion which exists is due to the vague idea that you’ve set in your head which has
occurred to you due to the existing infiltrators such as movies, songs, and all unreal stuff.
Rather you should follow your bodily and mental instincts and functions according to them.<br>
<h3>Mutual understanding</h3>
There is no denying the fact that one can feel the urge towards physical needs but one is
supposed to function responsibly, cognitively and once find mutual understanding, there’s
nothing wrong about it.</p>
